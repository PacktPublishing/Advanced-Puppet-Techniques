## About the Video Course
Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate all of your IT configurations, giving you control over what you do to each Puppet Agent in a network, and when and how you do it. In this age of digital delivery and ubiquitous Internet presence, it's becoming increasingly important to implement scalable and portable solutions, not only in terms of software, but also the systems that run it.
This video course starts with taking your Puppet knowledge to the next level by delving deep into concepts such as scaling the Puppet infrastructure, utilising storeconfigs with PuppetDB, and using different external node classifiers. Youâ€™ll then get your hands dirty by running Puppet components in Docker containers, using Puppet to create Docker images, and running applications on Docker along with orchestration using Mcollective. At the end of the course, you will learn how to write custom plugins for Puppet such as facts, resource types, providers, and functions.
